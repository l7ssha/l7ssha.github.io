<h3>Orwo MA8</h3>

<p>
    I got my hands on Orwo MA8 document copying film. It is slow, contrasty and often very badly expired.
</p>
<p>
    I wanted to write my review on this film, but in the middle of writing I gave up and decided to post only my last results.
</p>

<p>
    I had 3 bulk rolls of this film, two bulk rolls of 5 meters each and one 30m roll. First two bulk rolls were badly expired and I
    couldn't get much from this film. Lots of base fog, high contrast and scratches, marks, dots and other kinds of scuffs.
</p>

<p>
    My last bulk roll (30m one) was a lot better. Clear base (no fog), lower amount of scuff marks and higher effective speed.
</p>

<p>
    I tried this film as negative, and it gave contrasty but good-looking negatives at EI 12. Also, I tried developing it as slide film using
    Foma R100 process (Fomadon LQR 1+11 for 15 minutes, potassium permanganate bleach). It gave me normal (ish) contrast positives
    at EI 12. Slightly underexposed could give better results if exposed correctly.
